# mono-traversable-keys

Provides type-classes for interacting with monomorphic containers in the following was:

 * zipping
 * adjusting an element at a key
 * safe indexing with a key
 * unsafe indexing with a key
 * mapping with a key
 * folding with a key
 * traversing with a key
 * zipping with a key

This package is the extension of two other popular libraries, [`mono-traversable`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mono-traversable) and [`keys`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/keys), designed to provided the functionality of the `keys` package to the monomorphic containers enhanced by the `mono-trversable` package.
